# Firedoor Documentation

Welcome to Firedoor, a Kubernetes Breakglass Access Management System that provides secure, time-limited access to cluster resources during emergencies or maintenance windows.

## What is Firedoor?

Firedoor is a Kubernetes operator that manages "breakglass" access - temporary, elevated permissions that can be granted to users during critical situations. It provides:

- **Time-limited access**: Automatically revoke access after a specified duration
- **Recurring schedules**: Set up regular access windows for maintenance
- **RBAC integration**: Seamlessly works with Kubernetes RBAC
- **Audit trails**: Complete logging and monitoring of access events
- **Emergency protocols**: Quick access during critical situations

## Use Cases

### Emergency Access

When you need immediate access to fix critical issues:

```yaml
apiVersion: access.cloudnimbus.io/v1alpha1
kind: Breakglass
metadata:
  name: emergency-access
spec:
  schedule:
    duration: "1h"
  clusterRoles:
    - admin
```

### Maintenance Windows

Schedule regular access for system maintenance:

```yaml
apiVersion: access.cloudnimbus.io/v1alpha1
kind: Breakglass
metadata:
  name: maintenance-window
spec:
  schedule:
    cron: "0 2 * * 0"  # Every Sunday at 2 AM
    duration: "4h"
  clusterRoles:
    - cluster-admin
```

### Development Access

Provide developers with temporary elevated access:

```yaml
apiVersion: access.cloudnimbus.io/v1alpha1
kind: Breakglass
metadata:
  name: dev-access
spec:
  schedule:
    duration: "8h"
  policy:
    - namespace: "development"
      rules:
        - apiGroups: ["*"]
          resources: ["*"]
          verbs: ["*"]
```
